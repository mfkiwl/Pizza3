# 🏗️ Sandbox Directory for Pizza3

This directory serves as a workspace for developing and testing early-stage scripts for the Pizza3 project. It contains experimental and proof-of-concept code that may evolve into fully-fledged features or utilities.

---

## 📋 Purpose
- A **safe space** to test new ideas and algorithms.
- A **temporary home** for scripts that are not yet ready for production.
- A **repository for prototypes** that could inspire future developments.

---

## ⚠️ Notes
1. **Work-in-Progress**: Files in this folder are likely incomplete, unoptimized, or experimental.
2. **No Guarantees**: Scripts may contain bugs, deprecated methods, or unsupported features.
3. **Documentation**: Minimal or placeholder documentation may be available for scripts.

---

## 📚 Usage
- **Testing Grounds**: Use this space for trial and error without affecting the main project.
- **Development**: Refactor and improve scripts here before moving them to appropriate folders (e.g., `utils`, `data`, `examples`).

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance
- Periodically **review and organize** scripts.
- Move finalized or stable code to appropriate project directories.
- Remove outdated or obsolete files to keep the sandbox clean.

---

🌟 **Remember**: Great ideas often start in the sandbox!
