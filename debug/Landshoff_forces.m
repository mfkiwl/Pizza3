% translating respectively to each other with a velocity difference

% INRAE\Olivier Vitrac, Han Chen - 2023-02-23

% [ SYNOPSIS ] This code simulates the displacement of two layers of particles
% in a fluid using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The two layers are
% represented by the "fixed" and "movable" structures, which contain information
% about the size, number, position, and velocity of the particles in each layer.

% [ DESCRIPTION ] The code simulates the movement of two layers of particles in a fluid
% using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The particles in the two layers are
% represented by the "fixed" and "movable" structures, which contain information about
% the size, number, position, and velocity of the particles in each layer. The Landshoff
% forces between particles in the two layers are calculated using the kernel function and
% SPH parameters, and the positions of the particles in the "movable" layer are adjusted
% to be as close as possible to the particles in the "fixed" layer. The forces are plotted
% as arrows on the particle plot using the "arrow" function, and the plot is updated with
% each iteration. The code also includes options for recording the plot as a GIF.


%% The code begins by defining the "layerplot" function, which creates a scatter plot of the particles
% in a layer using circles with a radius equal to the particle size.
% The particle size is set to 0.5 units for both layers, and the "fixed" layer contains 14 particles,
% while the "movable" layer contains 10 particles. The particles in the "fixed" layer are arbitrarily
% fixed in place, while the particles in the "movable" layer are free to move.
% layer plot
layerplot = @(X) viscircles([X.x X.y],X.R*ones(X.n,1),'color',X.color);

r = 0.5;
fixed = struct( ...these particles are arbitrarily fixed
    'R',r, ...
    'n',14,...
    'y',-r,...
    'dx',1e-2,...
    'dy',0,...

    );

% The positions of the particles in each layer are initiallyset up in a linear array along the x-axis,
% with some randomness added to the spacing between particles.
% The positions of the particles in the "fixed" layer are then shifted along the y-axis
% by a fixed amount, while the positions of the particles in the "movable" layer are shifted
% by a smaller amount along both the x- and y-axes.
fixed.x  = linspace(-(fixed.dx+fixed.R*2)*(fixed.n-1)/2,(fixed.dx+fixed.R*2)*(fixed.n-1)/2,fixed.n)';
movable.x = linspace(-(movable.dx+movable.R*2)*(movable.n-1)/2,(movable.dx+movable.R*2)*(movable.n-1)/2,movable.n)';
fixed.y = ones(fixed.n,1) * (fixed.y + fixed.dy);
movable.y = ones(movable.n,1) * (movable.y + movable.dy);

% redistribute with some randomness fixed beads along x
x0 = fixed.x(1);
dx = diff(fixed.x);
dxrandom = abs(randn(fixed.n,1))*fixed.R*0.25;
x = x0+[cumsum([0;dx]+dxrandom)];
fixed.x = x - mean(x);

% redistribute with some randomness top beads along x
x0 = movable.x(1);
dx = diff(movable.x);
dxrandom = abs(randn(movable.n,1))*movable.R*0.4;
x = x0+[cumsum([0;dx]+dxrandom)];
movable.x = x - x(1) + mean(fixed.x(1:2));

% Next, the kernel function and SPH parameters are defined.
% The kernel function is used to calculate the smoothing function
% for the SPH method, and the parameters include the smoothing length (h),
% the density (rho), and the coefficients (c0 and q1) used in the Landshoff force calculation.

% The code then enters a loop that simulates the movement of the particles over time.
% In each iteration, the position of the "movable" layer is shifted by a fixed amount
% along the x-axis, and the particles are then repacked along the y-axis to be as close
% as possible to the particles in the "fixed" layer. This is done using the "distance"
% and "iclosest" functions to find the closest particle in the "fixed" layer to each
% particle in the "movable" layer, and then adjusting the positions of the particles
% in the "movable" layer accordingly.
